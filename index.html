            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hey, I’m Aaron — a self-taught developer from Boston with a
              passion for building clean, smart, and purposeful applications.
              I’m currently focused on full-stack JavaScript, but I’ve got a
              solid Python foundation and a deep love for computer science
              fundamentals like algorithms, databases, and system design.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              I didn’t take the traditional path into tech — instead, I built my
              own curriculum using Codecademy, Udemy, and a stack of books,
              fueled by caffeine, curiosity, and cold plunges (seriously,
              face-dipping in ice water beats coffee any day). I’m not learning
              to land a job — I’m learning to build my own apps, like
              <a href="https://poolio.fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                >Poolio</a
              >, a savings and investing platform for groups. Every line of code
              I write moves me closer to that vision.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              When I’m not knee-deep in JavaScript, Python, or PostgreSQL, I’m
              probably optimizing my study setup with noise-canceling headphones
              and fasting to stay laser-focused. I believe programming is a
              superpower, and I’m here to wield it with precision, creativity,
              and just a bit of fun.
            </p>

          <summary>Computer Science Career Path</summary>
          <p>
            Through Codecademy’s Computer Science Career Path, I built a strong
            foundation in programming and computational thinking using Python. I
            learned essential data structures like lists, stacks, and queues,
            and explored how computers manage memory through algorithms. The
            program also introduced key computer science topics such as
            databases with PostgreSQL, computer architecture fundamentals, and
            discrete mathematics. These lessons were reinforced with hands-on
            projects and quizzes that strengthened both my problem-solving
            skills and practical coding ability.

          <summary>Intermediate Python 3</summary>
          <p>
            As part of my continued learning on Codecademy, I completed the
            Intermediate Python course, which deepened my understanding of core
            programming concepts and best practices. I gained hands-on
            experience with advanced function arguments, variable scope,
            higher-order functions, object-oriented programming, and unit
            testing using Python’s built-in unittest framework. The course also
            covered iterators, generators, and specialized collections like sets
            and defaultdict, along with effective resource management using
            context managers. Through a series of projects and quizzes, I
            sharpened my skills in writing clean, modular, and testable Python
            code.
